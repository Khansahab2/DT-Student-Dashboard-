## Student Dashboard For analyzing their response 

**Note: Please ignore grammatical mistakes** 

So, here's my project 
In this project, I made a student dashboard where we can select students based on their responses.

In the real world, there are many scenarios where the students use chatGPT to answer factual questions. 

Due to this all do not get the same chance. 

In this Dashboard, we solve this issue, by selecting the student based on the persona 
The persona is divided into five personality traits
1- Risk-taking(adventurousness) 
2- Self-learning
3- Sense of achievement 
4- Cross-functional thinking 
5- Ability to take feedback

Each trait is given a mark by the innovator.
